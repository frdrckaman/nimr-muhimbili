                                    Kilosa research Station originates from the Rectal Artesunate Clinical (RECTOCAP) Trial which was carried out in Kilosa District from 1999. The Station is within the Kilosa District Hospital, located in at about 100 km from Morogoro in central Tanzania. The Station utilizes hospital buildings renovated using funds obtained from the Swedish Embassy in Tanzania. In 2000, permission was granted by the district health authorities to re-construct three permanent offices to constitute a research base for a clinical trial. In 2006, the Kilosa clinical trial offices were formally absorbed into the structure of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) of Tanzania as the Kilosa Station under NIMR’s Muhimbili Centre.
