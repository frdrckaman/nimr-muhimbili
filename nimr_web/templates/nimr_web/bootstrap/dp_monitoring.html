                                    Muhimbili Medical Research Centre, has developed strategic and action plan that gear
                                    programmes and projects evolved together with the planned development system. From the
                                    very outset, efforts have been made to make the monitoring and Control department more
                                    scientific, effective, practical, and useful. In this context, Monitoring and Control (M&amp;C)
                                    department represents the effort of the NIMR-Muhmbili to carry out a regular and systematic
                                    monitoring and evaluation that keep track of inputs, activities, processes, outputs, outcomes
                                    and impacts of programmes/projects being implemented at the centre to make sure that
                                    decision, processes and policy formulation processes are evidence-based after being provided
                                    with relevant data, information, and feedback.

                                    As such the department is mandated to provide continuous management of projects to assess
                                    if progress is made in achieving expected results, to spot bottlenecks in implementation, and
                                    to highlight whether there are any unintended effects (positive or negative) from an
                                    investment plan, programme or project (“project/plan”) and its activities.

                                    Our department uses multiple strategies to address goals and targets of the projects, and it has
                                    a key role to play in the successful implementation of plans, policies, programmes and
                                    projects which constitute the backbone of national development.
